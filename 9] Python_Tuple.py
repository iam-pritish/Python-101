# Working with tuple is very similer as List.
# Carete Empty tuple 

t1 = ()

# Let's Assing index value or append the tuple

# t1[0] = 3
# t1.append(5)
# print(t1)    #>>>>>>> Tuple does not support item assignment or any updates

t2 = (20,30,40,50,60)   #>>>> this tuple is fix no append,delete,update,concat

print(len(t2))          # Length works
#>>> 5

print(t2[3])            # Indexing works
#>>> 50

# Slicing and Iteration also works
