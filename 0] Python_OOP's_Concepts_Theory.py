# What is Programming in General?
# Programs are set of Rule or Instructions for manipulating Data in a meaningful ways.

# In object orirnted Programmming [OOP's] Paradigm we can design the program using Class & Objects
# The main Intension of getting these Classes and creating Objects is to, we can Re-use the code 
# in differnt ways within code.

# Major Principles are : { "CO-MIP-DE"}
# 1] Class
# 2] Object
# 3] Method
# 4] Inheritance 
# 5] Polymorphism
# 6] Data Abstraction
# 7] Encapsulation 

# Class :---> It is defined as COllection of OBjects
# It is logical Entity Which has some specific Attributes and Methods
# 
# for example :- If you have Employee Class, Then It should contain Attributes and Method to 
#                elaborate the specifictions of the Class (i.e. email_ID,Name,Age,Salary and so on...)
# Here we can create Many and unique objects form a single class
# Class Define a 'Type'
# The process of creating an Object form a Class in called "Instantiantion"

#           my_name = 'Virat'
# Here we have creted a new single Varible called 'my_name' with the Value of 'Virat' in it
# This Variable is actually a reffernce to an 'Object'
# The type of Object is 'str' -because in order to creat it we Instatiationlized the in-built "str" class
#
